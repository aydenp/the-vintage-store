        <h2>The Story. <span>The Why.</span></h2>
        <p>It's increasingly easy to overlook the roots of today's tech. The Vintage Store turns back the clock and allows enthusiasts to own a piece of the past's most remarkable computing inventions as if brand new. These machines are not just historical artifacts, rather they signify pivotal moments in the development of technology, shaping our society and the way we interact with the world today.</p>
        <p>When you purchase from The Vintage Store, you get a machine preserved to the highest of standards. Where necessary, we refurbish components with those resembling their originals down to the fullest extent possible, following schematics to a tee.</p>
        <p>We plan to expand our collection in the future with more curated computers.</p>
