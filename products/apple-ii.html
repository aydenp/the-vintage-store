    <h1>Apple II</h1>
    <p class="lead">June 1977</p>
    <p>Crafted by the legendary duo of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the Apple II set the standard for the personal computing phenomenon, turning the tide from a world where computers were mere tools of businesses and academia, to a new dawn where they became an integral part of our homes.</p>

        <p>The Apple II that graces our collection today is not just a computer, but a beautifully preserved artifact. Its beige chassis, tactile keyboard, and the green phosphor glow of the monitor form an aesthetic that embodies the very essence of retro computing. More than just an object, it's a gateway into nostalgia. The soft hum of the cooling fan whispering tales of a time when programming was a novel adventure, and the sight of the iconic rainbow Apple logo was still a fresh thrill.</p>
        <p>This machine played a pivotal role in the early story of the tech giant we now know as <em>Apple Inc.</em>, and by extension, the entire computing industry. The Apple II series, in its elegance and simplicity, empowered the ordinary individual, not only to use a computer but to grasp the concept of computing. It was this machine that saw the birth of now-giant software industries, from the likes of <em>VisiCalc</em>, which introduced the idea of electronic spreadsheets, to the early days of gaming with titles like <em>The Oregon Trail</em>.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the journey, where every keystroke brings the past alive, right here, with your Apple II.</p>
