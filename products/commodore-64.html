        <p>The year 1982 saw the birth of this iconic machine which set a record for selling an unprecedented 17 million units. The Commodore 64, with its charming brown casing, distinctive keyboard, and its in-built RF modulator, was an introduction for many to the realm of home computing.</p>
        <p>Reviving the charm of the early computing era, this well-preserved Commodore 64 invites you to delve into over 10,000 games and software titles, unrivaled in the 8-bit era. It brought not only entertainment into homes but served as a starting point for a generation of programmers.</p>
        <p>Imagine the thrill of maneuvering pixels across the screen in the classic game of <em>Space Invaders</em>, the rhythmic clacking of keys as you tap out lines of BASIC code, the satisfaction of seeing your first program spring to life - this is what the Commodore 64 offers.</p>
        <p>Welcome back the golden era of home computing with your Commodore 64.</p>
